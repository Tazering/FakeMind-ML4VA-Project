# ***ML4VA FakeMind - Video Script***

## **Requirements and Notes**

- based on checkpoint and proposal
- 3-5 minutes
- upload to Youtube
- all members need to have participated

## **Observations from other Example Videos**

- talk about what was done
- talk about features
- does not seem to have to be super high accuracy
- some are funny

**Good videos to Note**

## **Script**

1. **Problem Statement and Objective**
    - virginia news/farmer's testimony of the effects of droughts
    - problem statement
    - statistics

2. **Dataset and Analysis**
    - data analysis
    - observations
    - preprocessing
    - features
    - outputs

-----------------------
    - Tyler: ~30s on the graphs and preprocessing
    - Alex: ~30s merging meteostate with drought data

3. **Methodology and Results**
    - RNN
      - training accuracy
      - validation accuracy
    - RNN w/ LSTM
      - training accuracy
      - validation accuracy
    - Linear Regression
      - training accuracy
      - validation accuracy
    - ANN
      - training accuracy
      - validation accuracy

-----------------------
    - Alex: ~RNN (w/ LSTM) and Logistic Regression (~ 1 - 2 min)
    - Kamil: Results (~ 1 min)

1. **Future Work and Conclusion**
    - deployment
    - projected consequence
      - how this will help farmers
      - other things that could be done
    - Credits

------------------------
    - Tyler ~ 30s 
      - mobile application for farmers and possibly (nature conservationists)
      - Consequences
        - farmers are more prepared for droughts
        - more prepared for forest fires
      - Additional Works
        - other models to try: ANN and SVM (non linear kernels)
